This project is based on NVIDIA's particle simulation sample.
The original particle simulation only handles particle collisions, while inter-molecular interactions, which govern the most intriguing features of water motions, are not implemented. This project provided simulation of incompressibility, viscosity, and vorticity to the source code, and all these simulations are all parallel-computed in GPU.
